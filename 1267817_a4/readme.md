## Student Information 
Name : Elise Pitre

Student Number : 1267817

## Assignment Overview
The goal of the program is to:
1. Read a graph's adjacency matrix from a `.txt` file.
2. Provide options to display the graph's adjacency list, perform BFS, DFS, and find the shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
3. Ensure robust file handling, input validation, and proper memory management.

    Menu Options Include:
    1. **Display Adjacency List**: Convert the adjacency matrix into an adjacency list and display the list for all vertices.
    2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traverse the graph using BFS starting from vertex 1.
    3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverse the graph using DFS starting from vertex 1.
    4. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Compute and display the shortest path from vertex 1 to all other vertices using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
    5. **Exit**: Quit the program.
