Program Description

    The program aims to:
        - Read a graph's adjacency matrix from a .txt file.
        - Offer functionality to display the adjacency list, perform BFS and DFS, and compute shortest paths using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
        - Ensure reliable file handling, input validation, and efficient memory usage.
    
    Menu Options:
        Display Adjacency List: Converts the adjacency matrix to an adjacency list and displays it for all vertices.
        Breadth-First Search (BFS): Performs BFS starting from vertex 1.
        Depth-First Search (DFS): Performs DFS starting from vertex 1.
        Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Calculates and displays the shortest paths from vertex 1 to all other vertices.
        Exit: Closes the program.
